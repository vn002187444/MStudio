## 2023-10-10 - Missing Form Focus States
**Learning:** This app's global CSS sets a custom `focus-visible` ring on `a`, `button`, and `summary` but missed `input` and `textarea`. Because custom CSS reset/override was used without encompassing all interactive elements, keyboard accessibility suffered on form fields like Search or Editor inputs.
**Action:** Always verify that custom global focus rings cover all focusable form controls (`input`, `textarea`, `select`), not just navigational or button elements.
